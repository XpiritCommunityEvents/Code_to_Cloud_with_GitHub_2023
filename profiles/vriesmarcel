### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Marcel de Vries

I am the co-founder and Global MD and CTO of Xpirit. Xpirit started as an individual company under the Xebia group in 2014 and is now transformed into the Microsoft service line of Xebia worldwide! Xpirit provides professional services to companies worldwide to build, manage and support their business when that runs on Microsoft Azure nad is build and maintained on Github or Azure DevOps. We build Cloud Native Software and provide Managed Services as part of our consultancy practices.

I spend most of my time working with organizations to deliver software to production multiple times a day in a secure and compliant way! I help organizations and leadership teams move the business needle by building an engineering culture.

I love to learn new technologies and use this to advance others. I share my learnings at conferences and through training.  I often explain leadership in technology companies that the CEO title in my opinion should have a second meaning: Coding Executive Officer. This is driven by my strong belief that great leaders in tech need to be technical! Only by staying on top of technology can you lead the people that live and work in tech!

I am a frequently asked public speaker at well-known industry events like Microsoft //Build, Microsoft Ignite, Azure Lowlands, Visual Studio Live!, Techorama, and KCDC, to name a few.

I am part of the Techorama board and organize this event in Europe. In my spare time, I also build online courses for Pluralsight. You can find my courses here: https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/marcel-devries

I have been awarded by Microsoft the Microsoft MVP award for more than 17 consecutive years and I am also a Microsoft Regional Director since 2008.
